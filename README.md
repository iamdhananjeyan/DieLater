# DieLater
DIELATER is a AI based multilingual web application that Is available in both TAMIL and ENGLISH languages.
The main purpose of DIELATER is to give information about the government construction work going in a particular city.
Using this user can effectively avoid traffic congestion,road accidents indirectly reducing their stress and tension levels.
Our web application comes in two login methods consisting of ADMINS-GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS and USERS-CITIZENS.
It also comes with an added advantage by providing accurate info about the date of completion of the government project.
This web application basically requires the location and destination of the user.On getting info the web application presents an optimized route without much traffic congestion.
The main advantage of the project is the benefit to the users due to the MULTILINGUAL INTERFACE assisted by GENERATIVE AI models. 
The primary goal of DIELATER is to contribute to the creation of a safer road environment.
By providing timely information on construction sites and traffic conditions, the app aims to reduce the likelihood of road accidents resulting from unexpected construction-related disruptions.
Sorry we couldn't finish the complete project because of some unexpected circumstances.
So we have uploaded only the frontend part of the webapp in this repository.
